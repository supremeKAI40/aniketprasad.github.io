We present here a validation of sub-Saturn exoplanet **TOI-181b** orbiting a K-type star TOI-181 $$(M_\star = 0.822 \pm 0.04\ M_\odot,\ R_\star = 0.745 \pm 0.02\ R_\odot,\ T_{\mathrm{eff}} = 4994 \pm 50\ \mathrm{K})$$, as a part of the **Validation of Transiting Exoplanets using Statistical Tools (VaTEST)** project.

TOI-181b is a planet with radius $$R_p = 6.95 \pm 0.08\ R_\oplus$$, mass $$M_p = 46.16 \pm 2.71\ M_\oplus$$, orbiting in a slightly eccentric orbit with $$e = 0.15 \pm 0.06$$, and a semi-major axis of $$a = 0.054 \pm 0.004\ \mathrm{AU}$$, with an orbital period of $$P = 4.5320 \pm 0.000002\ \mathrm{days}$$.

The transit photometry data was collected using the **Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)**, and the spectroscopic radial velocity (RV) data was collected using the **ESO-HARPS** (High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher) spectrograph. Based on the best-fit RV model, we measured an RV semi-amplitude of  
$$K = 20.56 \pm 2.37\ \mathrm{m\ s^{-1}}$$.

Additionally, we used `VESPA` and `TRICERATOPS` to compute the **False Positive Probability (FPP)**, and the findings yielded FPP values of **< 1%** from both tools, significantly below the standard validation threshold.

The discovery of TOI-181b is significant in the context of understanding the formation and migration history of analogous planetary systems, especially given the rarity of **warm sub-Saturns** in the known exoplanet population.

NASA’s all-sky survey mission, the **Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)**, is specifically engineered to detect exoplanets that transit bright stars. Thus far, TESS has successfully identified approximately 400 transiting exoplanets, in addition to roughly 6000 candidate exoplanets pending confirmation.

In this study, we present results from our ongoing project — **Validation of Transiting Exoplanets using Statistical Tools (VaTEST)**. This effort focuses on the confirmation and characterization of new exoplanets through the application of statistical validation techniques. By combining **ground-based follow-up observations**, **high-resolution imaging**, and the **TRICERATOPS** statistical validation tool, we have identified eight potential super-Earths: 

TOI-238b: $$ 1.61^{+0.09}_{-0.10}\ R_\oplus $$, TOI-771b: $$ 1.42^{+0.11}_{-0.09}\ R_\oplus $$, TOI-871b: $$ 1.66^{+0.11}_{-0.11}\ R_\oplus $$, TOI-1467b: $$ 1.83^{+0.16}_{-0.15}\ R_\oplus $$, TOI-1739b: $$ 1.69^{+0.10}_{-0.08}\ R_\oplus $$, TOI-2068b: $$ 1.82^{+0.16}_{-0.15}\ R_\oplus $$, TOI-4559b: $$ 1.42^{+0.13}_{-0.11}\ R_\oplus $$ and TOI-5799b: $$ 1.62^{+0.19}_{-0.13}\ R_\oplus $$

Among these, six planets lie in the so-called **"keystone planet"** regime, making them particularly intriguing. Notably, **TOI-771b** and **TOI-4559b** fall below the **radius valley**, suggesting they are likely **super-Earths**. However, future **radial velocity (RV)** mass measurements will be essential for their definitive characterization.

It is noteworthy that planets within the size range investigated herein are absent from our own solar system, making their study crucial for gaining insights into the **evolutionary stages** between Earth and Neptune.

title: "Deep learning for Gravitational Wave event localization"
excerpt: "I got a chance to test my deep learning lessons through a summer internship with Dr. Linqing Wen's group at University of Western Australia being part of Ozgrav team. I collaborated with [Dr. Chayyan Chaterjee](https://chayanchatterjee.com/project/gw-skylocator/), then doctoral candidate of Dr. Linqing working on training a mixture density model using tensoflow with a probablistic layer to predict the sky localizations of merger events. The work was adjudged the people's choice winner of the 3-Mintue-thesis styel competition held at UWA for all summer interns."

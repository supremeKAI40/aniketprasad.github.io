title: "Statistical validation of TESS exoplanet candidates"
excerpt: "The VaTEST project focuses on the statistical validation of exoplanet candidates discovered by NASA’s TESS mission. Initiated in May 2022, the project employs probabilistic frameworks and diagnostic tools to distinguish true planetary signals from astrophysical false positives. Combining photometric and spectroscopic data analysis with Python-based validation pipelines, [VaTEST](https://sites.google.com/view/project-vatest/home) aims to robustly confirm exoplanets—especially those lacking radial velocity follow-up—by computing false positive probabilities and planet likelihoods. The ongoing effort is expanding toward the bulk validation of unconfirmed candidates to accelerate population-level studies of exoplanets. <br/><img src='/images/exoplanet_vatest.png'><br/> plot taken from Vatest 3 where we manage to validate several keystone exoplanets"

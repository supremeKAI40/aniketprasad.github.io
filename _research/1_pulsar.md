title: "Drift Mode identification in multi-band uGMRT observation of PSR J0034-0721"
excerpt: "Worked on the single-pulse analysis of radio pulsars under Dr Manoneeta Chakraborty funded by Indian Academy of Science summer research fellowship. We aimed to identify the different drift modes exhibited by this pulsar during previous studies with GMRT and MWA. The frequency dependance of the drifting is essential to understand the emission of the radio pulsars. The work was very helpful as a stepping stone in the field of astronomy gaining in-hand experience with radio pulsar analysis. "

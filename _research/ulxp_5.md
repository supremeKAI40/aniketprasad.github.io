title: "Accretion onto Ultraluminous X-ray Pulsars"
excerpt: "<p>Ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs) are a rare and intriguing class of accreting neutron stars capable of sustaining super-Eddington luminosities. Among them, Swift J0243.6+6124 stands out as the only confirmed Galactic ULXP, making it an ideal target for studying emission variability across changing accretion regimes. As part of my master's thesis, we conduct a detailed spectro-temporal analysis of this source during its 2023 normal outburst, using observations from the NICER mission in the 0.7â€“10 keV range, supplemented by INSIGHT-HXMT for higher energy coverage (upto 250 keV).<p/> These insights aim to further our understanding of emission geometry and accretion dynamics in highly magnetized neutron stars operating in extreme luminosity regimes. The mystery of extreme luminosity obtained by accretion onto neutron star remains an open research question with physics of super-eddington accretion brought into question due to the kind of compact objects acting as central engine.<img src='/images/pulx_schematic.jpg'> <br/> *Figure: Schematic of super-Eddington accretion onto a ULXP(Mushtukov et al. 2017, 2019)*"

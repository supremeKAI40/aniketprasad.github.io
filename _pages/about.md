  Hello!!
</h1>

I am an incoming PhD researcher hoping to work on the **CHIME Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB)** project, with a primary focus on studying compact object environments through transient radio emissions and extracting cosmology from them. My research involves investigating emission physics and propagation effects such as scattering, Faraday rotation, and plasma lensing to probe the magneto-ionic media near FRB sources. With an interest in both population studies and individual source modeling, I aim to understand extreme astrophysical environments around neutron stars and black holes that give rise to coherent radio bursts and hopefully find microlensing in FRBs too. My work also intersects with high-time-resolution radio astronomy and statistical inference applied to large-scale transient datasets. Apart from this, I will also be working on the development of CHORD pipeline which will be instrumental in enhancing the time resolution for FRB search. 

Before starting my PhD, I conducted a **spectro-temporal analysis of ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs)** under the guidance of **Dr. Samir Mandal (IIST)** and **Dr. Aru Beri (University of Southampton)**. I studied luminosity-dependent pulse profiles and period variations to understand accretion column dynamics in super-Eddington regimes. Thus, essentially exploring the X-ray emissions of compact objects. 

Alongside transient and high-energy astrophysics, I have worked extensively on **exoplanet detection, validation, and characterisation**. I contributed to the **Validation of Transiting Exoplanets using Statistical Tools (VaTEST)** group, where we validated TESS planet candidates near the radius valley. I am also interested in the application of machine learning to astrophysical problems.

These diverse experiences has shaped my approach to astrophysics, combining compact object physics, large-scale transient event analysis, and statistical validation frameworks to address key challenges in the era of big data in astronomy.

Outside of research, I enjoy sharing astronomy through outreach talks and interactive sessions with curious minds. I often write poems, blending creativity with reflection, and keep active with football and table tennis.

I also love to travel and meet new people, always eager to explore new places, whether for observation trips, conferences, or the sheer joy of discovering something new.

# Hello there!!
I am a PhD researcher working on the **CHIME Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB)** project, with a primary focus on studying compact object environments through transient radio emissions and extracting cosmology from them. My research involves investigating emission physics and propagation effects such as scattering, Faraday rotation, and plasma lensing to probe the magneto-ionic media near FRB sources. With an interest in both population studies and individual source modeling, I aim to understand extreme astrophysical environments around neutron stars and black holes that give rise to coherent radio bursts and hopefully find microlensing in FRBs too. My work also intersects with high-time-resolution radio astronomy and statistical inference applied to large-scale transient datasets. Apart from this, I will also be working on the development of CHORD pipeline which will be instrumental in enhancing the time resolution for FRB search. 

Before starting my PhD, I conducted a **spectro-temporal analysis of ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs)** under the guidance of **Dr. Samir Mandal (IIST)** and **Dr. Aru Beri (University of Southampton)**. Using data from **NICER**, and **HXMT**, I studied luminosity-dependent pulse profiles and period variations to understand accretion column dynamics in super-Eddington regimes. This experience provided deep insights into emission mechanisms from compact objects, bridging observational X-ray timing with models of accretion physics.

Alongside transient and high-energy astrophysics, I have worked extensively on **exoplanet detection, validation, and characterisation**. At the **Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST)**, I contributed to the **Validation of Transiting Exoplanets using Statistical Tools (VaTEST)** group, where we validated TESS planet candidates near the radius valley. This included transit modeling, radial velocity analysis using **juliet**, and Bayesian validation using **TRICERATOPS**, with follow-up from **LCOGT** and **HARPS** under **TFOP** collaborations. I co-authored three papers and am currently leading a validation paper involving **MAROON-X** data on rocky planets orbiting cool dwarfs, addressing Earth-like planet occurrence around M-dwarfs while incorporating stellar noise mitigation in RV frameworks.

I also collaborated with **Dr. David J. Armstrong (University of Warwick)** to critically evaluate the statistical thresholds used in exoplanet validation. This ongoing work explores frameworks for validation in the context of large surveys like **TESS** and future missions such as **Roman**.

During a 2023 internship with **Dr. Vardan Adibekyan (University of Porto)**, I explored whether super-Mercuries form a distinct compositional population, gaining experience in statistical tests and clustering methods despite limited high core-fraction planet data.

My interest in the application of machine learning to astrophysical problems began during a project at the **University of Western Australia** with **Dr. Linqing Wen**, where I developed a **Gaussian Mixture Model** to estimate gravitational wave sky positions, winning the **3-Minute Thesis** award. This background supports my interest in combining physical models with data-driven techniques—particularly in stellar activity modelling, Bayesian inference, and transient event localisation.

These diverse experiences shape my approach to astrophysics, combining compact object physics, large-scale transient event analysis, and statistical validation frameworks to address key challenges in the era of big data in astronomy.

Outside of research, I enjoy sharing astronomy through outreach talks and interactive sessions with curious minds. I often write poems, blending creativity with reflection, and keep active with football and table tennis.

I also love to travel, always eager to explore new places—whether for observation trips, conferences, or the sheer joy of discovering something new.

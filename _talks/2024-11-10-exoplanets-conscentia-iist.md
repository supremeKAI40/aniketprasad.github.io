Gave a public talk as part of Conscentia, the annual science and tech festival of IIST. The session explored the evolution of exoplanet science â€” from early radial velocity discoveries to modern TESS-based statistical validation pipelines. Highlighted personal research with VaTEST, validation tools like TRICERATOPS, and the broader role of population studies in understanding planetary system architectures.
